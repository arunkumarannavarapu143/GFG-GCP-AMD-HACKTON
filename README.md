Description:

Our project is a fitness and sports application designed to help users achieve their fitness goals by providing them with workout suggestions and nutritional recommendations. The application is built using the React framework and utilizes MongoDB with Google Cloud Cluster for data storage and management.

The main features of our application include:

Recording Calories:
The application allows users to record their calorie intake by inputting the number of calories consumed in each meal. Users can set daily calorie goals and track their progress towards achieving them.

Recording Daily Food Intakes:
The application enables users to record their daily food intake by inputting the types and quantities of food consumed. Users can track their intake of macronutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, as well as micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals.

Nutrition Analysis:
The application provides users with nutrition analysis, which helps them understand the nutritional value of the food they consume. The application provides a breakdown of macronutrients and micronutrients, along with recommendations for maintaining a balanced diet.

Exercises According to Body Parts Along with Demo Videos:
The application provides users with a range of exercises that target specific body parts, such as legs, arms, abs, and back. The application includes demo videos that demonstrate how to perform each exercise correctly.

Recipes Search According to User Preferences:
The application allows users to search for recipes based on their dietary preferences, such as vegetarian, vegan, low-carb, or low-fat. The application provides a wide range of healthy and easy-to-prepare recipes.

User Profile Management:
The application enables users to manage their profiles by updating their personal information, setting fitness goals, and tracking their progress. Users can view their workout history, calorie intake, and other metrics related to their fitness journey.

Deployment:
The application is deployed on Gcloud, making it easily accessible to users from anywhere. This deployment method ensures that the application is reliable, scalable, and accessible to a large number of users.
Frontend: Develop the React app using popular frontend libraries and tools like React, Redux, Axios, etc. Organize the codebase using a modular architecture, such as the component-based architecture. Use a version control system, such as Git, to manage the source code.
Backend: Use Node.js or any other backend technology of your choice to handle API requests from the frontend. Follow RESTful or GraphQL API design principles to expose necessary endpoints for the frontend to interact with.
Containerization: Create a Docker image of the backend application, which includes the React app and Nginx web server configurations. Use a multi-stage Dockerfile to build the backend app and copy the static assets to the Nginx web server.
Deployment: Deploy the Docker image to Google Cloud Run, a serverless compute platform that automatically scales containers based on incoming traffic. Configure the Cloud Run service to run the Docker container with the desired resources, environment variables, and networking settings. Use a custom domain or a subdomain to access the deployed application.
Static Asset Storage: Store the static assets, such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, in an Gcloud bucket
